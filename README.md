This repo contains the complete source code for the CSE 210 Prove:Developer assignment for Unit 04.

# This is a game where the player will be confronted with falling rocks (O) and falling gems (*). When you collect a gem, you get 1 point. When you collect a rock, you lose 1 point.

#The director's GetInputs sets up the game so that it can run. The DOUpdates places the artifacts and the robot in play, while getting our score.

# The Actor class creates the color, positioning, and velocity for our game.

# Our artifacts will be the falling items, so we need to find the score of the rocks and gems.

# In our Color and Point class, we are getting the value of the coordinates and selecting the color for our falling objects.

# In our KeyboardServices class, we are reading what the player does and moving the robot accordingly.

# The VideoServices class draws our game so that we can display it.
